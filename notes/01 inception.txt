React - very popular JS library
react is very fast
make own notes

use Chrome and dev console
VS code

h1 tag created by JS and injected into root
cdn react -> only JS files - by facebook engineers
React vs ReactDom - create element vs create root
all react code runs inside the root - root.render()
react original philosophy - use JS to manipulate DOM 
most costly browser operation - DOM tree changes
react element is a JS object
render converts it to h1 tag
ReactElement(Object) => HTML(Browser Understands)
place siblings in an array
jsx solves above ugliness - makes it easy to create tags - no need to use React.createElement
but react can be written without jsx
order of cdn script files matters - must be before App.js
root.render method will overwrite existing tags; replaced not appended; only affects div id root
library vs framework - react can be applied also only to a portion of the page since not a full-fledged framework
react can work in existing app - only in a small portion of the app - eg apply to just a card
