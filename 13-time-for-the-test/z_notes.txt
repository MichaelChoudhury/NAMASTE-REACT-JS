QA testing
Developer testing
Manual testing or write code to test - test cases
many components interacting
3 types of testing by developer - manual - unit (in isolation), integration (multiple components, events), end to end or e-2-e (user start to end, large-scale, tools such as selennium)
testing is part of development

React Testing Library (used to be BOM testing library)
CRA has RTL out of the box
But we will build on top of parcel
RTL uses Jest library - js framework
Babel is a transpiler and Parcel uses Babel behind the scenes - thus can cause conflict between Parcel and Babel
jsdom - like a browser
